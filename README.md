  Background 

Our team that goes by the name “Team name” has taken the Student Academic System project topic. The project is for our Object Oriented class and the goal of this project is for us to create a program using the object oriented language JAVA. Our team consists out of 5 team members. Each member will contribute to the project over his GITHUB account. This project will give us the opportunity to better learn JAVA programming and also to better work in teams.

This application should have functionalities similar to functionalities of our schools students nformation system. System will have two roles, professors and students. The first rule or the professors’ rule should be able to to manage courses, grades, attendance, home works ect...
 Professors also should be able to easily communicate with students by having an announcement area where he can write special announcements like canceled classes and etc…
Students should be able to see registered courses, minor and final grade for specific course, weekly schedule,  attendance for courses, home work and project deadlines and etc.
